# 🏁 Getting started

## 📋 Requirements

| Tool              | Version                                                                      |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🟢 Node.js        | **24.15 or newer** (`.nvmrc` pins the active LTS line, `24`)                 |
| 📦 npm            | 11 or newer (ships with Node 24)                                             |
| 🔑 OpenWeatherMap | A free account and an [API key](https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys)    |
| 🌐 Browser        | Chrome, Edge or Firefox 111+, Safari 16.4+ (the Next.js 16 browser baseline) |

If you use a version manager, run `nvm use` (or `fnm use`) in the project root.

## 🔑 Environment variables

The app reads these variables on the server:

| Variable                 | Required | Meaning                                                                                             |
| ------------------------ | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY` | Required | Your OpenWeatherMap key. It is never sent to the browser                                            |
| `SITE_URL`               | Optional | The public address for canonical links, the sitemap and share cards, for example on a custom domain |
| `OPENWEATHERMAP_API_URL` | Optional | Another OpenWeatherMap-compatible host; the end-to-end tests point it at their mock server          |

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Paste the key into `.env`. Next.js loads `.env*` files automatically; every `.env*` file except `.env.example` is ignored by Git.

> [!NOTE]
> A brand-new key can take up to two hours to start working. Until then the app shows **The API key was rejected**. Without any key it shows **The weather service is not set up**.

> [!CAUTION]
> Never prefix the key with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`. That would inline it into the JavaScript every visitor downloads.

## 📦 Install and run

```bash
npm ci
npm run dev
```

Open <http://localhost:3000>. It redirects to your browser's language, for example `/en`, and opens Lviv; `/en?city=Tokyo` and `/uk?lat=51.51&lon=-0.13` open any other place in any language.

> [!TIP]
> No key yet? Start the mock server from the end-to-end tests with `node e2e/openweather-api.ts` and run the app with `OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY=e2e-key OPENWEATHERMAP_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:4020 npm run dev`. It knows Lviv, Kyiv, Reykjavik and Bangkok.

### 🐳 In Docker

```bash
docker compose -f compose.yaml -f docker/development.yaml up --watch
```

The same dev server runs in a container on port 3000 with the variables from `.env` (and `.env.local`, if present), and Compose Watch copies every change into it. Staging and production images are described in [Deployment](./deployment.md#-docker).

## 📜 npm scripts

| `npm run icons`         | 🌦️ Copies the animated and the still Meteocons the app uses into `public/icons`    |
| `npm run check`         | ✅ Lint, format check, type check and tests in one go, run it before pushing       |

Every feature has a `model/` folder for data and logic and, when it renders something, a `ui/` folder with one folder per component, for example `features/forecast/ui/WindCard/WindCard.tsx` and `WindCard.module.scss`. Tests sit next to the code they cover as `*.test.ts(x)`. The layers and their rules are explained in [Architecture](./architecture.md#-layers).

## 💻 Editor setup

Editor settings are not committed. For the best experience in VS Code, install:

- 🦀 **Oxc**: inline Oxlint diagnostics and Oxfmt formatting on save
- ⚡ **Vitest**: run and debug tests from the editor
- 🎭 **Playwright Test for VS Code**: run end-to-end tests and record locators
- 📝 **EditorConfig**: consistent whitespace settings (`.editorconfig` is part of the repository)

## 👉 Next steps

- ✨ Learn what the app can do in [Features](./features.md).
- 🏗️ Understand how a request becomes a forecast in [Architecture](./architecture.md).
- 🌦️ See how OpenWeatherMap data is fetched and cleaned up in [Weather data](./weather-data.md).
- 🧪 Run the whole suite as described in [Testing](./testing.md).
