# 🔎 SEO

Every forecast is a real page with its own address in every language, a descriptive title, share cards and structured data, so a link to `/uk?city=Kyiv` looks right in a search result, a chat or a social feed.

## 🏷️ Metadata

| Field                    | Forecast                                                  | Unknown city or missing page   |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| 🏷️ Title                 | `Kyiv 17° · Clear sky · Weather`                          | `City not found · Weather`     |
| 📝 Description           | The city, the temperature, the sky and what the app shows | The app description            |
| 🔗 Canonical             | `/en?lat=50.45&lon=30.52`, or `/en` for the default city  | none                           |
| 🌐 Alternates            | All ten languages and `x-default`                         | none                           |
| 🖼️ Open Graph and X card | The share card of the language, `summary_large_image`     | The share card of the language |
| 🤖 Robots                | `index, follow`, large image previews                     | `noindex, follow`              |

The defaults live in `src/app/[locale]/layout.tsx`, the forecast's metadata in `src/app/[locale]/page.tsx`. Both build their Open Graph and X fields through `social()` in `src/features/seo/model/seo.ts`, so the site name, the language, the alternate languages and the large card are never lost when a page overrides the title. `metadataBase` makes every URL absolute.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Next.js applies `title.template` only to **child** segments, not to a page in the same folder as the layout. The forecast and the 404 page therefore set `title: { absolute }` through `documentTitle()`, which appends the app name itself.

## 🔗 One address per forecast

| Address                          | Canonical                                   | Why                                                     |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/uk?city=Kyiv`, `/uk?city=kyiv` | `/uk?lat=50.45&lon=30.52`                   | Names are ambiguous and change case; coordinates do not |
| `/uk?lat=50.4501&lon=30.5234`    | `/uk?lat=50.45&lon=30.52`                   | Coordinates are rounded to about a kilometre            |
| `/uk?lat=49.84&lon=24.03`        | `/uk`                                       | The default city is the home page                       |
| `/UK?city=Kyiv`                  | redirects (`308`) to `/uk?city=Kyiv`        | Languages are lowercase                                 |
| `/?city=Kyiv`                    | redirects (`307`) to the visitor's language | `x-default` for people without a language in the link   |

`forecastSearch()` in `features/places/model/location.ts` builds the query part of the canonical link from the resolved place, so a search, a saved place and the location button all point to the same canonical address.

## 🌍 Languages

Each language version is a separate page with its own address, title, description and card, see [Localization](./i18n.md).

- 🔗 `<link rel="canonical">` points to the page in its own language.
- 🌐 `<link rel="alternate" hreflang>` lists all ten versions, and `x-default` points to the address without a language, which redirects by cookie or browser language.
- 🏷️ `og:locale` names the language (`uk_UA`), `og:locale:alternate` the other nine.
- 📄 `<html lang>` matches the address, also on the 404 page.

## 🌍 The public address

`siteUrl()` in `src/shared/lib/site.ts` decides the base for every absolute URL:

1. 🌍 `SITE_URL`, when it is set.
2. ▲ `VERCEL_PROJECT_PRODUCTION_URL`, which Vercel provides automatically.
3. 💻 `http://localhost:<PORT>` for local development.

> [!WARNING]
> `/sitemap.xml` and `/robots.txt` are prerendered during `next build`. Set `SITE_URL` before building on a custom domain, otherwise they keep the address that was known at build time.

## 🖼️ Share cards

`src/app/[locale]/opengraph-image.tsx` draws one 1200 × 630 card per language at build time with `ImageResponse` from `next/og`: the app icon, the name and the description of the app on a sky gradient. The card uses Montserrat from `src/shared/assets/fonts` in the Latin, Latin Extended and Cyrillic subsets, so Ukrainian, Czech and Polish render correctly, and has a translated `alt` text.

> [!NOTE]
> `next/og` reads TTF, OTF and WOFF fonts, but not WOFF2. That is why the share cards use their own WOFF files instead of the `@fontsource-variable/montserrat` package of the interface.

## 🗺️ Sitemap and robots

- 🗺️ `/sitemap.xml` lists the home page in all ten languages, each with its `hreflang` alternates. Forecasts for other cities are reached through links and the search action below.
- 🤖 `/robots.txt` allows everything except `/api/` and points to the sitemap.
- 🙈 On Vercel preview deployments (`VERCEL_ENV=preview`) robots disallow everything and every page is marked `noindex`, so previews never compete with the real site (`isIndexable()` in `site.ts`).

## 🧩 Structured data

Every forecast includes JSON-LD in its language (`inLanguage`), rendered by `JsonLd` from `features/seo/ui`:

| Type         | Content                                                                                                             |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🌐 `WebSite` | Name, description, author and a `SearchAction` with `/{language}?city={city}`, so search engines know how to search |
| 📄 `WebPage` | The canonical URL, title, description, language, the time of the forecast as `dateModified`                         |
| 📍 `Place`   | The city as the page's `about`, with `GeoCoordinates` and a `PostalAddress` with the country and region when known  |

`serializeJsonLd()` escapes every `<` as `<`, so a city name can never close the script tag.

> [!TIP]
> Validate changes with the [Rich Results Test](https://search.google.com/test/rich-results) or the [Schema Markup Validator](https://validator.schema.org/), and check share cards with the preview of the network you post to.

## 🚫 Pages that should not rank

- 🔎 A search without a match (`/en?city=Atlantis`) and broken coordinates show **City not found** with `noindex, follow`.
- 🚧 A failing weather service shows its error with `noindex, follow`, so a temporary problem never replaces a forecast in the index.
- 🧭 Unknown addresses answer with a real **404** status and a translated page marked `noindex`.

## ⚡ Page experience

- 📄 The page shell, the header and the search are server-rendered HTML; the forecast streams in as soon as the weather arrives.
- 🔤 Montserrat is self-hosted and every script subset is downloaded only when a character needs it.
- 🖼️ Every image has explicit `width` and `height`, and charts are SVG drawn on the server, so nothing shifts when the page loads.
- 🧭 `manifest.webmanifest`, an SVG icon, an Apple touch icon and theme colours for light and dark mode are generated from `src/app`.
- 🚦 A Lighthouse budget in CI keeps performance, accessibility, best practices and SEO in check, see [Testing](./testing.md#-lighthouse-budget).
